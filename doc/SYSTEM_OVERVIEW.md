# Tibetan Buddhist Translation System: Comprehensive Documentation

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Tibetan Buddhist Translation System, an agentic workflow designed to produce high-quality translations of Tibetan Buddhist texts into various target languages. The system combines Large Language Models (LLMs), structured workflows, and domain-specific knowledge to create translations that are both accurate to the source material and linguistically fluent in the target language.

## System Architecture

The translation system is built on a multi-stage pipeline using LangGraph, which orchestrates a series of specialized processors that each handle specific aspects of the translation task. The core design follows a node-based workflow where each node performs a specialized function and passes its output to subsequent nodes.

### Key Components

1. **Commentary Processors**: Handle the translation and analysis of traditional Buddhist commentaries
2. **Translation Processor**: Generates initial and refined translations of the source text
3. **Evaluation Processor**: Assesses translation quality and provides feedback
4. **Formatting Handler**: Ensures proper structural alignment with source text
5. **Glossary Generator**: Creates glossaries of technical terms and their translations

### Data Flow

```
Source Text + Commentaries → Commentary Translation → Commentary Aggregation → 
Initial Translation → Evaluation → Iterative Improvement → Formatting → Glossary Generation
```

## Prompt Engineering Approach

The system uses carefully crafted prompts designed to extract maximum performance from LLMs. Key approaches include:

1. **Few-shot Learning**: Uses examples to guide the model's output format and style
2. **Multi-turn Conversations**: Structures prompts as system/human/AI message sequences
3. **Language-specific Instructions**: Ensures translations sound natural in target languages
4. **Domain-specific Context**: Provides Buddhist terminology and philosophy guidance

### Example Prompt Structure

```
System: [Role definition and task description]
Human: [Example input]
AI: [Example output]
...
Human: [Actual task]
```

## Key Modules in Detail

### 1. Commentary Processing

The system handles three types of commentaries with different focus areas:

- **Commentary 1**: Translation with expertise focus
- **Commentary 2**: Translation with philosophical focus  
- **Commentary 3**: Translation with traditional interpretation focus

When commentaries are empty or missing, the system falls back to zero-shot commentary generation.

#### Commentary Aggregation

The commentary aggregator combines translated commentaries into a single coherent explanation of the source text. It:

1. Integrates insights from all available commentaries
2. Structures the explanation to follow the source text line by line
3. Preserves all key philosophical points
4. Ensures all technical terminology is properly explained

### 2. Translation Generation

The translation generator has multiple stages:

1. **Initial Translation**: Produces first translation with thinking enabled
2. **Plain Translation**: Creates a simplified, accessible translation
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Improves translation based on feedback

#### Plain Translation Approach

The plain translation feature creates an accessible version of the text for readers without specialized Buddhist knowledge by:

- Using straightforward language
- Simplifying complex concepts
- Maintaining the core meaning
- Using natural, flowing language in the target language

### 3. Evaluation System

The evaluation system assesses translations on multiple dimensions:

1. **Language Verification**: Checks if the translation is actually in the target language
2. **Content Accuracy**: Verifies alignment with source text and commentaries
3. **Structural Formatting**: Ensures the translation preserves the source format
4. **Linguistic Fluency**: Checks that the translation sounds natural in the target language

#### Verification Process

Before grading, the evaluator performs a structured verification:
- Validates that the text is in the correct target language
- Checks for missing concepts from commentaries
- Identifies potential misinterpretations
- Verifies contextual accuracy
- Assesses linguistic naturalness in the target language

For more details on language verification, see [LANGUAGE_VERIFICATION.md](LANGUAGE_VERIFICATION.md).

### 4. Formatting Handler

The formatting handler ensures the translation preserves the structural characteristics of the source text:

- Matches line counts and segments
- Preserves verse form when present
- Maintains paragraph breaks
- Respects sentence boundaries

### 5. Glossary Generation

The glossary generator extracts and documents technical terms:

- Identifies Buddhist terminology in the source text
- Records original Tibetan terms and their translations
- Provides usage context and category information
- References commentary explanations
- Ensures all glossary information is in the target language

## Error Handling and Robustness

The system incorporates multiple layers of error handling:

1. **Batch Processing Retry Logic**:
   - Attempts to process batches with configurable retries
   - Falls back to individual processing when batch processing fails
   - Implements time delays between retry attempts
   - Handles persistent failures gracefully

2. **Commentary Handling**:
   - Gracefully handles missing or empty commentaries
   - Falls back to zero-shot generation when no commentaries are available
   - Preserves partial output when only some commentaries are available

3. **Response Parsing**:
   - Handles different response formats from the thinking LLM
   - Extracts text content while discarding thinking artifacts
   - Validates responses for completeness and integrity

## Multi-language Support

The system is designed to support multiple target languages:

1. **Language Parameter**: All processors accept a language parameter to customize output
2. **Language-specific Prompting**: Instructions emphasize natural expression in the target language
3. **Linguistic Requirements**: Custom guidance for grammar, syntax, and idiomatic expression
4. **Cultural Adaptation**: Ensures terminology is culturally appropriate
5. **Language Verification**: Validates that translations are in the correct target language
6. **Multilingual Examples**: Includes few-shot examples in various languages (English, Chinese, Italian, Russian)
7. **Language-Aware Extraction**: Ensures extracted content is in the specified target language

## Workflow Integration

### LangGraph Configuration

The system uses LangGraph to define a directed graph of processing nodes:

```python
# Sample workflow edges
optimizer_builder.add_edge(START, "commentary_translator_1")
optimizer_builder.add_edge("commentary_translator_1", "aggregator")
optimizer_builder.add_edge("aggregator", "translation_generator")
optimizer_builder.add_edge("translation_generator", "llm_call_evaluator")

optimizer_builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "llm_call_evaluator",
    route_translation,
    {
        "Accepted": "generate_glossary",
        "Rejected + Feedback": "translation_generator",
        "Wrong Language": "translation_generator"  # New route for language issues
    }
)
```

## Utility Tools

### Batch Processing

The batch processing utility handles multiple translations with robust error recovery:

```python
python batch_process.py --input test.json --batch-size 3 --retries 4 --delay 10 --language Italian
```

Key features:
- Configurable batch size
- Multiple retry attempts with time delays
- Individual processing fallback
- Detailed progress reporting

### Glossary Extraction

The glossary extraction tool compiles terms from completed translations:

```python
python generate_glossary.py --input results1.jsonl results2.jsonl --output glossary.csv
```

Features:
- Processes multiple input files
- Deduplicates entries
- Preserves target language
- Structures output in a standardized CSV format

## Performance Considerations

1. **Context Window Management**: The system carefully manages prompt sizes to avoid hitting LLM context limits
2. **Batching Strategy**: Uses appropriate batch sizes to optimize throughput
3. **Error Recovery**: Implements graduated fallback strategies to maximize completion rate
4. **Resource Efficiency**: Uses thinking abilities selectively for complex tasks

## Testing and Validation

The system includes testing capabilities to verify component functionality:

- **Unit Tests**: Verify individual processor functions
- **Workflow Tests**: Validate end-to-end processing
- **Batch Tests**: Ensure robust handling of multiple items

## Development Guidelines

When enhancing the system, follow these principles:

1. **Prompt Design**: Ensure prompts provide clear instructions with examples
2. **Language Support**: Always include language-specific requirements
3. **Error Handling**: Implement robust fallback mechanisms
4. **Modularity**: Keep processors focused on single responsibilities 
5. **Documentation**: Document all changes and design decisions

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Context Window Errors

**Problem**: LLM returns errors about exceeding max tokens.
**Solution**: Reduce the size of few-shot examples or limit the complexity of prompts.

### Inconsistent Output Format

**Problem**: LLM sometimes returns improperly formatted responses.
**Solution**: Use structured output with Pydantic models to enforce consistency.

### Batch Processing Failures

**Problem**: Batch processing fails with certain inputs.
**Solution**: Use the robust batch processor with retry logic and fallback to individual processing.

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for system improvement include:

1. **Domain-specific Fine-tuning**: Train specialized models on Buddhist terminology
2. **Parallel Processing**: Implement concurrent processing for higher throughput
3. **Terminology Database**: Build a comprehensive glossary of Buddhist terms across languages
4. **Human-in-the-loop**: Add interfaces for expert review and refinement
5. **Quality Metrics**: Implement quantitative evaluation of translation quality
