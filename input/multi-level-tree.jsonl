It begins by establishing bodhichitta's superiority over all other virtues in overcoming powerful negativity and its unique role in bringing beings to supreme joy (verses 6-8). It describes the transformative change in status for one who generates it (verse 9) and uses various analogies—alchemy, a wish-fulfilling jewel, a miraculous tree, a heroic bodyguard, and cataclysmic fire—to illustrate its power to lead to Buddhahood, its immense worth, its inexhaustible and increasing nature, and its capacity to eradicate even the gravest evils (verses 10-14). The section then distinguishes between bodhichitta in intention and action, outlining their respective benefits, particularly the unceasing merit of active bodhichitta (verses 15-19). Finally, it proves these benefits through scriptural citations (verse 20) and logical reasoning, emphasizing bodhichitta's unparalleled altruism and efficacy in bringing happiness and dispelling suffering for all beings (verses 21-30).",
